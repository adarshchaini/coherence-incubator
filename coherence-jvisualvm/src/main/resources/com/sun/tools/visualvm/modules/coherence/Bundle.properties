OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plug-in provides a GUI to allow developers to view information about a running Coherence Cluster. <br> \
    Once installed, when you connect to a local or remote process running a Coherence MBean server you will see a "Coherence Tab" \
    which allows you to view Coherence related information for that cluster. <br><br> \
    The following tabs are displayed: \
    <ul> \
      <li>Overview - Displays high-level information about the Coherence cluster including cluster name, version, member count and 'Cluster StatusHA'. Summary graphs show total cluster memory available and used, packet publisher and receiver success rates and load averages for machines running Coherence.</li> \
      <li>Machines - Displays a list of the physical machines that make up the Coherence cluster as well as information about the load averages and available memory on these machines.</li> \
      <li>Members  - Displays the full list of Coherence members/nodes including individual publisher/ receiver success rates, memory and send queue sizes.</li> \
      <li>Services - Displays information about the running services including partition counts and statusHA values. If you select a service, on the next data refresh you will see detailed thread information for each node of the service as well as graphs of that information. </li> \
      <li>Caches   - Displays information about any caches including size, and memory usage information. To get the correct information to be displayed for memory usage, you must be using the binary unit-calculator. If you select a cache, on the next data refresh you will see detailed information about each node hosting that service and cache. </li> \
      <li>Proxy Servers  - If your cluster is running proxy servers, this tab displays information about the proxy servers and the number of connections across each proxy server and total connections. </li> \
      <li>Coherence*Web - If your cluster is configured for Coherence*Web, this tab displays information about the number applications deployed, the number of HTTP sessions being stored as well as other information regarding session reaping. \
    </ul> <br> \
    Please see http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/coherence/COHMG/jmx.htm for more information on enabling JMX on your \
    Coherence cluster. \
    <br><br>Note: This is a developer tool for viewing information about a single cluster at a time. A tool such as Oracle's Enterprise Manager \
    is suited for enterprise level monitoring, management and alerting.
